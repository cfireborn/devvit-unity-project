Testing Bayou later (Phase 5)

  When you're ready to test WebGL/Bayou specifically, the fastest workflow is:

  1. Host stays in Unity Editor — add Bayou back to NetworkManager,
  TransportManager → Bayou
  2. Build WebGL client → File → Build Settings → WebGL → Build → output to
  Builds/WebGL/
  3. Serve it locally in terminal:
  cd /Users/cfire/Desktop/devvit-unity-project/Builds/WebGL
  python3 -m http.server 8080
  4. Open browser → http://localhost:8080 → the WebGL game loads and connects to
   your editor host via WebSocket

  No Edgegap account needed for local Bayou testing — the editor server and
  browser client talk directly over localhost. Full Edgegap deployment only
  needed when you want remote players.
